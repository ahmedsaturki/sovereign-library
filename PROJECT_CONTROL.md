# Sovereign Library — Project Control

## The one-current-task rule

At any moment there is exactly **one active milestone** and **one immediate next task**.

Everything else is parked in `ROADMAP.md` or an issue. New ideas do not enter the current task unless required for its gate.

## Current milestone

**PHASE-0-RELEASE-AUTHORIZATION-READY**

### Immediate next task

Obtain the explicit release-authorization decision for the two verified candidates: `@sovereign/safe-path-resolver` v0.1.0 and `@sovereign/runtime-capability-inspector` v0.1.0. Until that decision exists, do not publish, create/reserve an npm organization, configure npm tokens, add registry automation, or announce a public release.

### Completed Phase 0 gates

1. Inventory & Classification — **DONE / FROZEN** in PR #105.
2. License decision and repository licensing artifacts — **DONE / FROZEN** in PR #106; Apache-2.0 is authoritative on `main`.
3. Public API boundary freeze — **DONE / VERIFIED**; Run #782 passed on Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS-15-Intel.
4. Type/declaration strategy without a full rewrite — **DONE / VERIFIED**; Run #809 passed on Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS-15-Intel.
5. Package contract — **DONE / VERIFIED**; PR #108 merged at `b7b8f985058fb4a13e73cf255dd6fdf7508da5bd`; Run #812 passed on Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS-15-Intel.
6. Package tooling implementation — **DONE / VERIFIED**.
7. Reproducible `npm pack` and security verification — **DONE / VERIFIED** by Run #835.
8. Publication guard — **DONE / WIRED / VERIFIED** by Run #845 on all supported platforms.
9. Release-readiness record — **DONE / FROZEN**.
10. Release authorization packet — **DONE / FROZEN**.

## Governing release records

- `docs/PUBLIC_PACKAGE_RELEASE_READINESS_V0.1.md`
- `docs/PUBLIC_PACKAGE_RELEASE_AUTHORIZATION_PACKET_V0.1.md`

## Declaration strategy artifact

`docs/DECLARATION_STRATEGY_V0.1.md` is the governing decision record.

The repository remains JavaScript-first. Public declarations are produced incrementally from JSDoc with no TypeScript runtime dependency and no full source rewrite.

## Release sequence

Cube work follows:

`SPEC -> IMPLEMENT -> TEST -> FIX -> VERIFY -> RELEASE -> FREEZE -> NEXT CUBE`

Phase 0 readiness work is controlled by the same one-current-task discipline; it does not authorize parallel Cube implementation.

The public package release path is:

`READY -> EXPLICIT AUTHORIZATION -> FINAL CLEAN VERIFY -> TAG/RELEASE -> PUBLISH -> POST-PUBLISH VERIFY -> FREEZE`

## Definition of done

A Phase 0 task is DONE only when its decision artifact is reproducible, CI-verified, documented, and merged to `main` with the control plane advanced to exactly one next task.

## Anti-loop rules

- Do not redesign the whole architecture during readiness work.
- Do not add dependencies merely to solve a local problem without a recorded decision.
- Do not start a second Cube while a Phase 0 task is active.
- Do not turn a technically complete cube into a public package without API/package/security/release-authorization gates.
- Do not call a package production-ready from source inspection alone.
- Do not treat CI success as publication authorization.
- Park out-of-scope work and continue.

## Recovery rule

If work is interrupted, read this file first, then `ROADMAP.md`, then the latest Git commit. Resume from the listed immediate next task; do not restart from memory.
